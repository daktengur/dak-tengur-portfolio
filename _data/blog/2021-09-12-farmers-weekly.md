## Overview

Farmers Weekly interactive (FWi) is UK’s most popular agricultural publishing website, providing news and insights to over half a million visitors a month.

Offering readers handy articles on making their business more profitable, it goes hand-in-hand with the weekly magazine publication.

## Goals

Evolve the perception of FWi beyond ‘getting just the latest farming news’. Redesign the website in such a way that it becomes the ‘first port of call’ when it comes to research or learning farming knowledge.

Improve the website design to allow for frictionless user consumption of articles through registration and good usability.

Improve on existing Marketing and Sales methods resulting in more online revenue through better content marketing and advertising.

## Challenge

In 2013, FWI.co.uk went through a redesign. The goals of improving the website’s user experience was accomplished through a responsive website. Fast forward a few years however, the website soon became bloated with unused plugins, content overload and inconsistent design.

The key issues to be addressed were:

1. Navigating and finding great content
Whilst the website did a great job for users who wanted to consume the ‘latest content’, the website lacked in meeting the goals of users who wished to view more specific articles with discoverability limited to search.

2. Relevant articles written years ago were lost deep in the archives of search results.
The information architecture was limited to main categories (for example ‘Livestock’) and sub-categories (for example ‘Beef’) only. 

3. Omni-channel reading experience
The reading experience felt bloated and heavy with different content or call-to-actions competing for user attention, ultimately reducing the ease of readability on the page. And, whilst the design was borrowed from the magazine palette, more could be done to bridge the gap between the reading experience of the magazine in hand to that online.

4. Usability issues and consistent look and feel
In some pockets of the website, high-traffic pages which yielded a high number of returning visitors were not mobile friendly (such as Weather). And, an organic growth in content led to custom styles being used sporadically ultimately creating an inconsistent look and feel.

We had **a lot** to do!

## Roles and Responsibilities

I worked on this project as the lead designer, responsible for the end-to-end UX strategy and refreshing the Farmers Weekly digital footprint.

I worked alongside some great people across Editorial, Marketing, Sales and Product Development.

My responsibilities included:

* Workshop facilitation (requirements gathering, discovery and ideation) UX / BA analysis (user flows, analysing analytics and applying insights)
* Design (low-fidelity wireframes, interaction specifications, visual design, styleguide) 
* Research (customer panels, discussion guides)
* Assisting front-end development (shadowing developers for pixel-perfect implementation and styling, and seamless dev-design hand-off or technical feasibility)
* Graphic design (iconography, marketing assets, newletters)

## Design Process
I used a mixture of Agile and Lean UX to help get traction and product shipped. With a large project such as this, the process below reflects my approach to both micro and macro deliverables.

### Navigating and finding great content

Using the **Core Model** and **Impact Mapping** exercises as workshop techniques early on in the project immediately helped get all people in the room on the same page for redesign goals.

I facilitated these workshops to help various teams focus on the core tasks which users needed to accomplish and seeing how the business goals aligned with it. From this, we could better plan, create and deliver content or functionality to help both goals and spend less time discussing on what should go on the homepage.

### Refining and validating ideas

The takeways from the core model exercise gave us clarity, order and priority. Some insights were:

**1. Topic pages**
With years of great content already at our finger-tips, highly curated topic pages could be created and maintained through a defined content strategy.

**2.Modular functionality**
With Wordpress as the CMS, Editorial teams wanted flexibility in terms of the website structure which later gave rise to the modularisation of the design and technical implementation.

From the diagrams drawn in the exercise, I had a good base to start modelling our early concepts on with key elements of the topic page including a brief description, curated content (editorially driven), popular content (peer-to-peer driven), latest articles and tools or resources of related value (this could be in-depth guides from third-party partners).

Early wireframes gave a simple schematic presentation of the pages and allowed quick rounds of iterations based on stakeholder feedback and user testing through questionnaires and research panels.

Keeping in mind visual rhythm, information chunking and eye-gazing patterns, I set the page structure in a row format, allowing for easier scanning and interpretation of the information. Real articles titles were used in the spirit of content-driven design.

A few other insights that I applied were:

* Due to low broadband speeds in rural areas of the UK, users had issues in loading the website. From an Editorial side, most images used tend to be stock based and thus most wireframes were low on visual imagery.
* I A/B tested user journeys for better product marketing clickthroughs on the legacy website in parallel and the numbers revealed a 20% higher clickthrough rate when using more specific copy, image and placement of content marketing. And so modules for contextual marketing were added to the designs.

Once we were 80:20 content with the wireframes, I proceeded to apply the visual design. To bridge the gap between the print and web reading experience, I used the Farmers Weekly brand and sector colours as my colour palette.

Early testing of the topic pages with a research panel of farmers revealed plenty of positive feedback with negative feedback largely targeted towards advertising. The results informed further edits, including the toning down of visual imagery on the page due to most articles sharing a similar image (such as ‘soil’ in the case above).

## Slicing the information architecture

With solid user backing, I worked with the product owner to examine how these topic pages could be added to the information architecture (IA).

The existing IA allowed for vertical slices of the content, however in the content audit and inventory performed, we discovered a horizontal way of navigating the content. The below shows ways in which sub-categories (across Livestock, Arable, Business and Machinery) were sliced to allow easier navigation into a more user-centric and lifecycle-based view of the areas.

Further, the type of articles could be broken down to more than just ‘news’ and ‘in depth’ content, allowing for better article relevancy.

## A few touch ups

To reflect the feedback from users and information architecture changes, the topic designs and website navigation were updated in a later sprint. Naming of this section was validated in the user testing panel and final branding determined by a user poll.

## Omni-channel experience

With a strong print user base and the business goal of converting more users to the online platform, there was an opportunity to do more with the design to help users on a visceral level.

I worked with multiple stakeholders to elicit further requirements:

* Print designer - to help inform a similar styleguide.
* Online editor - to understand, analyse and recommend improvements to the article publishing process.
* Front-end developers - to style existing HTML and CSS elements for legacy content, ensuring a pristine overall look and feel.

## Improving usability

To view premium articles, users must sign in or register. For the latter, a quick heuristic evaluation saw many pain-points with the legacy form. To tackle this, I worked with the Marketing team to determine better ways of achieving the same result through a better UX implementation.

A key improvement include was the reduced total number of clicks. Previously, users had to click on an option, click on the revealing dropdown field and click again on a dropdown option, resulting in extra clicks for the user. Using information chunking, progressive and relevant discovery based on past selections, I reduced this from 3 clicks to 1 click and reduced the cognitive load.

## Going responsive

Specific pages were designed with mobile use in mind. In cases such as the Weather page, minimal asset load (through compressed images), gestural controls (to allow affordance) and better information sectioning (to enable less cognitive load) were just some of the techniques used for an optimised page experience.

Using research findings from a questionnaire helped to prioritise features that users may/may not be interested in and keeping in mind user personas - new features were added. For example, providing the ability to view hourly data for the previous few hours for farmers who are getting ready to harvest their crops and a radar view of the country.

## Outcome

**1. Winner of PPA Digital Awards 2018** 

The website was crowned 'Website of the Year 2018' at the PPA Digital Awards 2018 on 1 November 2018.

The PPA is a publication association with almost 300 publishing companies, who together publish more than 2,500 consumer, customer and business magazines.

**2. A new content strategy**
A new content strategy had been formed as a result of the Know How knowledge hub being created. Over the long run, it provides Farmers Weekly with a defined structure to ensure the seamless creation, curation and governance of content.

**Users love it**

A post redesign survey was held, revealing some whopping insights:

* 76% of website visitors thought the new website was “better” or “a lot better” than before, with almost half saying the website was “a lot better”.
* The redesign was particularly praised for its ease of use, clearer layout and navigation which made it easier to find what the users wanted. 
* The new ‘Know How’ section of the website was a welcome addition.
* 67% said the content in the ‘Know How’ section of the website was useful, with 28% indicating they're yet to explore it.

## Learnings and Reflections

The redesigned website was released with a huge success. Behind the scenes was a year-long project filled with learning lessons eventually me become a better designer:

**Evolving and contextualising my process**

Different stages of the project required different approaches. Some cyclical in nature, some more long-winded and others with zero stakeholder input. Adapting my process based on the situation at hand is something I learnt and evolved as the project went.

**Adapting to change**

I was lucky enough to work with talented designers and teams from the Netherlands in hopes of forming a single implementation for two websites (Farmers Weekly and Boerderij). Unfortunately midway through the project, business strategies changed and we had to pivot. I had to quickly update my processes, logistics and design tools had to be changed quickly to ensure progress and for the development to continue.
