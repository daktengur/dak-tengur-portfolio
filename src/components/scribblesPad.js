                To keep my case studies succinct, I decided to share only the most pertinent
                pieces of work used in my design process. Often though, there's some great work
                behind the scenes often captured at the beginning of the messy "figuring things
                out" lines of a design process, or unused concepts which progressed the final
                design. Here's a cheers to those equally crucial bits.
